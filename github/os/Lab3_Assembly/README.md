# x86-64 Assembly 

> "Nearing Machine Code Representation"

Not so long ago (in a galaxy not so far away), programmers wrote most of their code in assembly. While programmers today primarily use higher level languages (Python, C, etc), it is not uncommon to debug the assemble of your code. Afterall, these higher level languages are typically translated into an assembly or assembly-like language as part of the compilation process. 

In cybersecurity and reverse engineering, programmers often work with and analyze assembly code. For high performance applications like games and visualization, programmers may write very optimized code using assembly to achieve higher performance than the code a compiler generates. If you are working on hardware or an embedded device, you may also do some assembly programming, as other languages environments are too bulky to support on a small device. Even web developers are using 'webassembly'. Hmm, the list is getting long here--I think the point is that learning assembly has quite some relevance! Let's dig in and get some practice.

In today's lab you are going to get some practice looking at and writing assembly.

# Part 1 - Assembly - A first program

The first task is to actually just write a 'hello world' in assembly.

- Enter the following text into a file called *hello.s*
- ```asm
	  # Example for x86-64 processor using AT&T Style syntax
	.global _start

	.text

	_start:
		# Write a message to the screen
		mov $1, %rax
		mov $1, %rdi
		mov $message, %rsi
		mov $13, %rdx
		syscall

		# Exit the program
		mov $60, %rax
		xor %rdi, %rdi
		syscall

	message:
		.ascii "Hello, World\n"
  ```
- Save the file and then we will assemble the program using the GNU Assembler (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Assembler)
  - `gcc -c hello.s`
  - This step builds an object file (.o suffix).
  - We now need to create an executable object file using our previously created hello.o file using a tool called *ld*
  - `ld hello.o -o hello`
    - Run `man ld` to learn more.
  - When this has been completed, push hello.s to your repo, and move on!

There are a few interesting things with this program.
1. First, there is a *global* symbol. The global sets up the starting point, as our program needs some entry point. You could think of '_start' as 'main' like in a C program. You can learn more here: http://web.mit.edu/gnu/doc/html/as_7.html#SEC89
2. The next directive (remember, lines that start with a '.' are directives) is .text. These are where our instructions start. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14544068/what-are-data-and-text-in-x86
3. The next few lines are moving some values into registers. The first statement moves the immediate value $1 into register %rax. A few more lines down we see a syscall.
	  1. What is a syscall? In short, it is a call to a function built into the operating system (More here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-introduction-system-call/).
	  2. To figure out which syscall it is, use this resource: https://filippo.io/linux-syscall-table/
4. Finally at the end there is a label ('message:') with a string literal (.ascii "Hello, World\n"). https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26502_01/html/E28388/eoiyg.html

## Aside - Machine Representation of Numbers

  * Note: it may be beneficial to look at this ascii table to see how numbers and letters are represented. See `man ascii`  or  https://www.asciitable.com. Remember, we do not have a 'text' datatype in assembly. Text instead is represented by numbers shown in the ascii table.

# Part 2 - Compiler Generated Assembly

Let us get some experience reading assembly code generated by the compiler! It is actually kind of fun, and you may learn some new instructions.

I **strongly** recommend using the godbolt tool (https://godbolt.org/) to write and experiment. The color mappings will help you see what is going on with the generated assembly.

Then you are required to get practice generating the assembly from your compiler (as instructed below).

## Compiler generated assembly 1 

- Write a C program that swaps two integers(in the main body of code).
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as swap_int.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin swap_int.c -S -o swap_int.s`
- Now modify your program to swap two long's.
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as swap_long.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin swap_long.c -S -o swap_long.s`
- Compare each of the two assembly files using diff. See what changed.
- diff syntax
  - Use: `diff -y swap_int.s swap_long.s`

## Compiler generated assembly 2 

- Write a C program that swaps two integers in a **function** (You may use today's slide as a reference)
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as swap.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin  swap.c -S -o swap.s`
- Do the instructions use memory/registers in a different way?

## Compiler generated assembly 3 - Static Array
- Write a C program called array.c that has an array of 400 integers in the function of main.
  - Initialize some of the values to something (do not use a loop) (e.g. myArray[0]=72; myArray[70]=56; etc)
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as array.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin  array.c -S -o array.s`
- How much are the offsets from the address?

## Compiler generated assembly 4 - Dynamic Array 

- Write a C program called array2.c that has an array of 400 integers in the function of main that is dynamically allocated.
  - Initialize some of the values to something (do not use a loop) (e.g. myArray[66]=712; myArray[70]=536; etc)
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as array2.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin  array2.c -S -o array2.s`
- Study the assembly and think about what is different from the static array.

The screenshot below may also help illustrate something interesting.

## Compiler generated assembly 5 - Goto
The C programming language has a 'goto' command, search how to use it if you have not previously.

- Write a C program using the goto command and a label.
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as goto.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin  goto.c -S -o goto.s`
- Observe what kind of jmp statement is inserted.

## Compiler generated assembly 6 - For-loops
- Write a C program using a for-loop that counts to 5.
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as for.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin  for.c -S -o for.s`
- Observe where the code goes for the condition statement (at the start or at the end?).

## Compiler generated assembly 7 - Switch Statements

- Write a C program using a switch statement (Sample here)[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/switch_statement_in_c.htm].
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as switch.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin switch.c -S -o switch.s`
- See what code a switch statement generates. Is it optimal?

## Compiler generated assembly 8 - Add Function

- Write a C program that calls an add function(long add(long a, long b).
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as add.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin add.c -S -o add.s`
- Observe the outputs
- Observe arguments put into registers
- Observe where 'popq' is called.

# Deliverable

- Complete the hello world from par1
- For part 2, add your .S files that you have generated to this repository.
  - Note this submission will be auto graded for completion (i.e. save the file names as shown).
  - Note it will be helpful to discuss your observations, and write in comments in the files for your records.

# Going Further

- (Optional) Try the objdump example to read the disassembly from your programs executables. Observe how close the output is to the compiler generated output.
